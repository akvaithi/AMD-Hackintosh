This is an EFI donwload created based on the Dortania Opencore Guide
https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/

This guide will cover on how to use the downloaded files and download the recovery images. (Video coming up soon on my channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7KFlJOEp_MDvMuCy76moWQ)

PLEASE DO NOTE 
it is recommeded by the Dortania Opencore guide and by me to make your own EFI instead of downloading a prebuilt one. This is only here if you need it in a pinch and can't make one on your own.

Now with that out of the way
